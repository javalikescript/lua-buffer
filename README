The Lua buffer module provides functions to deal with userdata as plain byte buffer.

The main use case is to allow native module to return interoperatble buffer
that could be manipulate at the script level then gave back to another native module.

Features:
- userdata buffer creation from size, string or userdata
- string like functions: len, byte, sub, tostring
- buffer manipulation functions: memcpy, memset, byteset

See the test.lua file to see the full usages.
